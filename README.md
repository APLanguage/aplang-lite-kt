# APLang-lite
APLang-lite is a language made only for self educational purposes (in contrast to APLang, which I plan to make more powerful).
So I can learn how to write parsers, interpreters, compilers (to APVM-lite and JVM) and virtual machines, before starting with the real deal.
In this project all 4 will probably be implemented using Kotlin.\
The project is a monolithic one, because it's easier to maintain for this purpose.
This project has already surpassed 4.5k lines of code.
The APVM-lite project will probably be also implemented in C++ for educational reasons.

The specs and more information about the VM and APLang-lite can be found in the [specs repository](https://github.com/APLanguage/aplang-lite-specs).
